# f1-lap-time-predictor
it is a project where people  bet in lap time donr in an f1 weakend 
vision of the project is to predict the lap times before hand it is based on the theory that knowledge of a large crowd always predicts the outcome very accurately as it is evident by illegal gambling market where people redict the outcome of sports elections etc if we average the prediction of everyone  it is very close to the real result
feature:- the gambling part is there so that people dont go wild and answere anything they want . The money incentivices people to predict to best of their knowledge.
future prospect is to remove the gambling part may be by providing reward in there favourite application or game or website or coupon etc
