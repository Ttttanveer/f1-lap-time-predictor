# F1 Lap Time Prediction Market üèéÔ∏è

A decentralized prediction market for Formula 1 lap times built on Ethereum, allowing users to predict both the fastest lap driver and time for real F1 races.

## Project Description

The F1 Lap Time Prediction Market is a blockchain-based platform that brings the excitement of Formula 1 racing to the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Users can stake cryptocurrency to predict who will set the fastest lap in upcoming F1 races and what that lap time will be. The platform rewards accurate predictions with a share of the total prize pool, creating an engaging and potentially profitable experience for F1 enthusiasts and crypto users alike.

Built as a Solidity smart contract, the platform automatically processes real F1 race results, calculates prediction accuracies, and distributes rewards to winners. The system incorporates real-time F1 data, including actual race schedules, driver lineups, and circuit-specific lap time validation.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize sports prediction markets by creating the most authentic and engaging Formula 1 prediction platform in the decentralized ecosystem. We aim to bridge the gap between traditional sports betting and modern blockchain technology, providing F1 fans with a transparent, fair, and community-driven way to showcase their racing knowledge while potentially earning rewards.

**Long-term Goals:**
- Become the premier destination for F1 predictions in the crypto space
